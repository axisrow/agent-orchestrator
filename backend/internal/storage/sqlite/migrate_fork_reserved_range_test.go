// forkReservedFloor is the first migration version reserved for fork-local
// migrations. Upstream numbers its migrations sequentially from 1 and will not
// reach this range, so a rebase can never make an upstream file collide with a
// fork one.
const forkReservedFloor int64 = 9000

// forkLocalMigrations lists the migrations that exist only on this fork.
// They must live at or above forkReservedFloor.
//
// Why this test exists: every sync rebase used to renumber these files onto
// whatever number was free next, and each move burned that number in
// goose_db_version on every live install. The upstream migration that later
// took the number was then skipped forever, and the daemon died at boot on a
// missing column. Measured over this fork's history:
//
//	add_user_config                       5 numbers (28, 32, 37, 41, 89)
//	normalize_activity_last_at            7 numbers (89, 95, 96, 99, 102, 103, 105)
//
// The 0100 collision (add_user_config had held it, then session_model took it)
// is what killed a daemon with "no such column: model". Pinning fork
// migrations above forkReservedFloor removes the collision at the source
// instead of adding one schemaRepairs entry per casualty.
//
// conversation_provider_ownership_epochs used to live here too (it churned
// through 100/101/103 the same way), but upstream shipped the identical
// migration as its own 0101_conversation_provider_ownership_epochs.sql — the
// fork now uses that file directly instead of carrying a duplicate at 9000+.
